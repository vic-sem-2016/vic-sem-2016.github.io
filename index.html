<p>This research-intensive honors seminar considered the Victorian novel as both a genre and a material object. Two questions animated the seminar: How are Victorian novels made? and How is scholarship about Victorian novels made? We explored the possibilities for rethinking canonical twentieth-century theories representational theories of novelistic realism, asking how Victorian novels might be said to refer to the real worlds their authors and readers inhabited. In response, we turned to the set of practices and processes through which Victorian novelists gathered the things of the world into their novels: research. Reading several major and minor Victorian novels, we traced the ways novelists searched sets of documents, took notes, and organized information to perform research of all kinds in the library and on the streets. We examined the published and unpublished commonplace books, notecards, papers, files, and marginalia of Anthony Trollope, Flaubert, George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Charles Reade, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, and Charlotte Bronte along with published descriptions of these novelists’ research practices and their representations of research in the novels they wrote. We engaged with criticism and theory from a number of fields, including book history, theories of materiality, historicisms old and new, theories of narrative and realism, genetic and textual criticisms, bibliometrics, media history, and digital humanities. <a href="https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/syllabus/blob/master/Vic_sem_2016_syllabus.md">Full syllabus</a>. </p>

<p>In collaboration with PJ Trainor, English Department Digital Fellow in Data Visualization, and Nabil Kashyap, McCabe’s Librarian for Digital Initiatives and Scholarship, 
This class will collaborate with  as we learn to incorporate various computational elements into our work, from the basics of plain-text authoring, citation management, and keeping an open research notebook to using digital tools to help us analyze individual novels and groups of novels. We will also collaborate with  to conceptualize and realize a series of visualizations of data drawn from individual novels and a larger corpus.</p>
