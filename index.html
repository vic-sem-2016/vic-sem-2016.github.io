<p>This research-intensive honors seminar centered around two simple central questions: How are Victorian novels made? and How is scholarship about Victorian novels made? We focused on the Victorian novel as both a genre and a material object, examining it within the context of the broader world of Victorian literature and culture in order to examine the ways in which the Victorian novel was both product and producer of its historical moment. We explored the possibilities for rethinking canonical twentieth-century theories representational theories of novelistic realism, following a recent flourishing in Victorianist criticism on referentiality in order to ask how Victorian novels may be said to refer to the real worlds their authors and readers inhabited. In order to study this theoretical question, we turned to the set of practices and processes through which Victorian novelists gathered the things of the world into their novels: research. Reading several major and minor Victorian novels, we traced different forms of evidence of the ways their authors searched sets of documents, took notes, and organized information to perform research of all kinds in the library and on the streets. We examined the published and unpublished commonplace books, notecards, papers, files, and marginalia of Victorian novelists both canonical and forgotten along with published descriptions of these novelists’ research practices and their representations of research in the novels they wrote. We engaged with criticism and theory from a number of fields, including book history, theories of materiality, historicisms old and new, theories of narrative and realism, genetic and textual criticisms, bibliometrics, media history, and digital humanities. <a href="https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/syllabus/blob/master/Vic_sem_2016_syllabus.md">Full syllabus</a>. </p>

<p>This class will collaborate with Nabil Kashyap, McCabe’s Librarian for Digital Initiatives and Scholarship, as we learn to incorporate various computational elements into our work, from the basics of plain-text authoring, citation management, and keeping an open research notebook to using digital tools to help us analyze individual novels and groups of novels. We will also collaborate with English Department Digital Fellow in Data Visualization to conceptualize and realize a series of visualizations of data drawn from individual novels and a larger corpus.</p>
