  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThis research-intensive honors seminar considered the Victorian novel as both a genre and a material object. Two questions animated the seminar: How are Victorian novels made? and How is scholarship about Victorian novels made? We explored the possibilities for rethinking canonical twentieth-century theories representational theories of novelistic realism, asking how Victorian novels might be said to refer to the real worlds their authors and readers inhabited. In response, we turned to the set of practices and processes through which Victorian novelists gathered the things of the world into their novels: research. Reading several major and minor Victorian novels, we traced the ways novelists searched sets of documents, took notes, and organized information to perform research of all kinds in the library and on the streets. We examined the published and unpublished commonplace books, notecards, papers, files, and marginalia of Anthony Trollope, Flaubert, George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Charles Reade, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, and Charlotte Bronte along with published descriptions of these novelists’ research practices and their representations of research in the novels they wrote. We engaged with criticism and theory from a number of fields, including book history, theories of materiality, historicisms old and new, theories of narrative and realism, genetic and textual criticisms, bibliometrics, media history, and digital humanities.

Clearly *The Warden*, *Barchester Towers*, *Doctor Thorne*, *The Small House at Allington*, *Framley Parsonage*, and *The Last Chronicle of Barset* only slowly and retrospectively came to seem - to both Trollope and to his readers - like a coherent series. But critics have been limited by our ability to conceptualize and model the interrelations between the six novels. \r\n\r\nDrawing on the 2015 seminar's discussions about Trollope's Barsetshire , including a corpus of the novels they prepared and their brainstorming about useful ways of modeling the series, the 2016 seminar collaborated with PJ Trainor, part of the Department of English Literature's pilot Digital Fellow program, and Nabil Kashyap, McCabe’s Librarian for Digital Initiatives and Scholarship, to develop one way of visualizing the series. \r\n\r\nAs part of PJ's Spring 2016 independent study in Literary Data Visualization, \r\n\r\n### Previous seminars and VNRS alumni group\r\n\r\n2015 Victorian Novel Research Seminar [syllabus](https://github.com/vic-sem-2015/syllabus/blob/master/vic_sem_2015.md) and [discussion outlines](https://github.com/vic-sem-2015/outlines). \r\n\r\n2013 Victorian Novel Research Seminar [course archive](https://courses.swarthmore.edu/spring2013/engl111/about/). \r\n\r\n### VNRS alumni network\r\nIf you are a VNRS alum and want to be added to our listserv, email me.
