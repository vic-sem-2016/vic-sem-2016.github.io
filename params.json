  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThis research-intensive honors seminar considered the Victorian novel as both a genre and a material object. Two questions animated the seminar: How are Victorian novels made? and How is scholarship about Victorian novels made? We explored the possibilities for rethinking canonical twentieth-century theories representational theories of novelistic realism, asking how Victorian novels might be said to refer to the real worlds their authors and readers inhabited. In response, we turned to the set of practices and processes through which Victorian novelists gathered the things of the world into their novels: research. Reading several major and minor Victorian novels, we traced the ways novelists searched sets of documents, took notes, and organized information to perform research of all kinds in the library and on the streets. [Full description and syllabus.](https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/syllabus/blob/master/Vic_sem_2016_syllabus.md).\r\n\r\nWe were lucky to have [Paul Fyfe](http://english.chass.ncsu.edu/faculty_staff/pcfyfe) (North Carolina State) as our [Honors Program](http://www.swarthmore.edu/honors-program) external examinar. \r\n\r\n### Members\r\nCorey Branch, Gaby Ekens, Luke Eppley, Anna Gonzales, Adriana Obiols Roca, Lanie Schlessinger, Yumi Shiroma, Nithya Swaminathan, \r\nRJ Tischler\r\n\r\n### Discussion Outlines \r\n\r\nPairs of seminar members created [extensive weekly discussion outlines](https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/outlines) each week in collaboration with Rachel. They include excerpts from each week’s student-written seminar papers, criticism summaries, close readings, and links to past outlines. Created primarily for the use of the seminar, they are also our primary public record of our work; seminar writing is by default not published online (though individual students are free of course to do so themselves).\r\n\r\n### Visualizing Barsetshire\r\n\r\nCritics have debated and discussed the status of Trollope's Barsetshire series. Clearly *The Warden*, *Barchester Towers*, *Doctor Thorne*, *The Small House at Allington*, *Framley Parsonage*, and *The Last Chronicle of Barset* only slowly and retrospectively came to seem - to both Trollope and to his readers - like a coherent series. But critics have been limited by our ability to conceptualize and model the interrelations between the six novels. \r\n\r\nDrawing on the 2015 seminar's discussions about Trollope's Barsetshire , including a corpus of the novels they prepared and their brainstorming about possible useful models, the 2016 seminar collaborated with PJ Trainor, part of the Department of English Literature's pilot Digital Fellow program, and Nabil Kashyap, McCabe’s Librarian for Digital Initiatives and Scholarship, to develop one way of visualizing the series. \r\n\r\nAs part of PJ's Spring 2016 independent study in Literary Data Visualization, \r\n\r\nPJ's current draft of a [visualization of themes across the Barsetshire Chronicles](https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/16/ptraino1/barsetshire/index.html) uses one bar to represent each chapter in each novel in the series. Drawing on a list of the 500 most frequently occurring words in each novel and across the corpus of six novels, the seminar came up with a series of wordlists corresponding with themes they saw developing across the novels (two of which, *The Warden* and *Barsetshire Towers*, they had read in their entireity. PJ then calculated the proportions of each \"theme\" in each chapter and represented ranges of theme appearance as shades: darker = more words related to a given theme in a chapter, light = less. \r\n\r\nThe familiar data viz form takes on new meaning here; looking a bit like books on a shelf, \r\nScroll over an individual chapter-bar and two pieces of data display: the topic percentage the the title. \r\n\r\n### Previous seminars and VNRS alumni group\r\n\r\n2015 Victorian Novel Research Seminar [syllabus](https://github.com/vic-sem-2015/syllabus/blob/master/vic_sem_2015.md) and [discussion outlines](https://github.com/vic-sem-2015/outlines). \r\n\r\n2013 Victorian Novel Research Seminar [course archive](https://courses.swarthmore.edu/spring2013/engl111/about/). \r\n\r\n### VNRS alumni network\r\nIf you are a Swarthmore Victorian Seminar alum and want to be added to our listserv, email me. \r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\r\nInternational License.
